# DBMS-PROJECT

This project is primarily used to deliver a customer's real-time review of a product.
A user can submit a product review in a variety of formats, including thorough 
reviews, images, and more. It employs sentimental analysis, which evaluates the 
user's product description and assigns a rating depending on the sentiment.
